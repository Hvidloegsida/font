  <p class="font-jost text-[#B7466E]">After deciding on the final design I moved it over in Illustrator where I redrew the whole font in vector, so that the font could be more versatile.  
    Making the font in vector format gives me the possibility to easier use it in many different ways. If you continue to the gallery, you will be able to see some of the ways I have edited the font.</p>
